To render a form, the form element needs an event handler with the event parameter.

There are several ways to get the value of the input:

- Via index: `event.target.elements[0].value`
- Via the elements object by their `name` or `id` attribute:
  `event.target.elements.usernameInput.value`

⚡`htmlFor` - the 'for' attribute

Instead of using the index which might change, another way is to use the React.useRef() hook. When on an element, a ref always points to the current DOM node whenever the node changes.

```
function MyComponent() {
  const myRef= React.useRef()

  return(
    <>
      <label></>
      <input ref={myRef}></input>
    </>
  )
}

⚡console.log(event.target) //logs the target element
console.dir(event.target) //logs the target element properties


To dynamically re-render app when there is a state change, we use the useState() hook. It returns an array that we destructure to get the state variable and the setState() function (the state has to be set using setState(), state ='new value' won't work).

⚡useState() and useRef() are hooks so they must be placed at the top of the componenet.

```
